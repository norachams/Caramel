"Subject: Thank the TDSB for Adopting an Anti-Palestinian Racism strategy\nSender: Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East <info@cjpme.org>\nBody: <https://www.cjpmecontent.org/tdsb_apr_policy>\n\nDear Nora,\n\nGreat news! Yesterday evening, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) voted to include anti-Palestinian racism <https://www.cjpme.org/pr_2024_06_20_tdsb> (APR) as part of its Combating Hate and Racism strategy! This means that the TDSB has committed to developing resources to inform students about APR, alongside other forms of discrimination including Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n\nThis is a major victory and is a result of important advocacy work by Toronto Palestinian families <https://torontopalestinianfamilies.ca/>, Toronto Jewish families <https://torontojewishfamilies.wordpress.com/>, and others. Acknowledging APR is critically important amid the skyrocketing incidents of violence and hate against Palestinians and their supporters. Unfortunately, pro-Israel organizations continue to oppose any mention of APR and are actively campaigning to have this decision reversed.\n\nDon't allow political pressure from pro-Israel groups erase Palestinian voices! Please click here to send a message to TDSB Trustees, the Ontario Education Minister, and other public officials. <https://www.cjpme.org/tdsb_apr_policy> Please join us in thanking the TDSB for their principled decision to address APR as part of its broader fight against all forms of racism\n\n<https://www.cjpmecontent.org/tdsb_apr_policy>\n\nPlease share this campaign:\n\n- Click here <https://nmshr.io/s/twitter/ZBE8BTXEHQ==/b> to Tweet, or retweet <https://x.com/CJPME/status/1803871768836260032> our campaign tweet\n- Click here <https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=870748418430704&set=a.482363290602554> like and share our Facebook campaign post\n- Click here <https://www.instagram.com/p/C8cvLJ5Te2b/> to like our main Instagram post\n- Forward <https://nmshr.io/s/email/ZBE8BTXEHQ==/b> this email to your friends\n\nMore Info\n\nA report <https://pub-tdsb.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=17569> adopted yesterday by the TDSB in a 15-7 vote <https://www.youtube.com/live/SVb3KShPlaM?feature=shared&t=21207> includes anti-Palestinian racism (APR) as an area of focus “in response to student and community voices,” and follows advocacy from Toronto Palestinian and Jewish families. This means that a working group will be formed to educate students on APR, alongside other forms of discrimination including Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n\nA working description of anti-Palestinian racism was first developed by the Arab-Canadian Lawyers Association (ACLA) in its 2022 report titled “Anti-Palestinian Racism: Naming, Framing and Manifestations <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61db30d12e169a5c45950345/t/627dcf83fa17ad41ff217964/1652412292220/Anti-Palestinian+Racism-+Naming%2C+Framing+and+Manifestations.pdf>.” The ACLA describes APR as “a form of anti-Arab racism that silences, excludes, erases, stereotypes, defames or dehumanizes Palestinians or their narratives,” and identifies various forms of APR, including “denying the Nakba and justifying violence against Palestinians,” “failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people with a collective identity,” and “defaming Palestinians and their allies with slander such as being inherently antisemitic, a terrorist threat/sympathizer or opposed to democratic values.\n\nThe need to adopt APR as part of anti-racism strategies around Canada is corroborated by the rise of violence and discrimination against Canadian Palestinians and their allies. Some recent examples of hateful acts include",Not applicable

"Name,\n\nMy Squad brother Jamaal Bowman lost his Congressional primary yesterday after being outspent 7 to 1.\n\nJamaal visited my Palestinian sity in Palestine’s West Bank when I couldn’t, and he recognized her humanity without hesitation. Unlike many of our colleagues in Congress, Jamaal hasn’t bowed down to those who believe killing thousands of Palestinian children is acceptable.\n\nBecause Jamaal believed that Palestinians deserve to live, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent nearly $20 million to unseat him.\n\nThis is the most expensive U.S. House of Representatives primary ever. Funded mainly by far-right billionaires, AIPAC saturated the airwaves with racist attack ads and encouraged Republicans to register as Democrats to vote against Jamaal.\n\nWe can’t let AIPAC undermine our democracy or scare lawmakers into continued unconditional support for Israel’s military. So we’ve got to defend AIPAC’s next target: Rep. Cori Bush.\n\nLike Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush is a courageous leader for Palestinians’ human rights. AIPAC has already spent $2 million supporting Cori’s anti-ceasefire opponent, and the group will spend many millions more over the next month before Cori’s August 6th primary election in Missouri.\n\nCan you help Cori Bush overcome millions of dollars in attacks from pro-genocide billionaires? Please rush an urgent donation to our re-election campaigns today.\n\nRUSH A DONATION\n\nBack in October of last year, Cori heeded the call from the grassroots to introduce a Congressional resolution demanding a ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza. Like Jamaal, Cori was one of the first members of Congress to correctly refer to these attacks on Palestinians as ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nIn 2014 Cori met Palestinian activists on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri while protesting for Black lives, and she saw the connections between Black and Palestinian struggles against state violence. Since then, she’s criticized the U.S. government’s complicity in Israel’s human rights abuses",Not applicable
